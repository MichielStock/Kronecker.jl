    isprob(A::AbstractArray)

Test if a matrix can be interpeted as a probability matrix, i.e., all elements
are between 0 and 1.

    isprob(K::AbstractKroneckerProduct)

Test if a Kronecker product can be interpeted as a probability matrix,
i.e., all elements are between 0 and 1.

"""
    naivesample(P::AbstractKroneckerProduct)

Sample a Kronecker graph from a probabilistic Kronecker product P using the
naive method. This method has a time complexity in the size of the Kronecker
product (but is still light in memory use). Consider using `fastsample`.
